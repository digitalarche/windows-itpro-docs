# Configure the Basic group policy for Windows Update for Business

For Windows Update for Business configurations to work, devices need to be configured with minimum [diagnostic data](/windows/privacy/configure-windows-diagnostic-data-in-your-organization) level of "Basic." Additionally, compliance reporting for configured devices is obtained using [Monitor Windows Update with Update Compliance](./update-compliance-monitor.md). To view your data in Update Compliance [diagnostics data must be enabled](/windows/deployment/update/windows-analytics-get-started#set-diagnostic-data-levels) and the devices must be configured with a commercial ID, a unique GUID created for an enterprise at the time of onboarding.

|Policy name|Description |
|-|-|
|Allow Telemetry|Enables Microsoft to run diagnostics on your device and troubleshoot.|
|Configure Commercial ID|This policy allows you to join the device to an entity.|

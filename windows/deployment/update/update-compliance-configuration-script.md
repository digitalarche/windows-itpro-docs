# Configuring devices through the Update Compliance Configuration Script

> [!NOTE]
> A new policy is required to use Update Compliance: "AllowUpdateComplianceProcessing." If you're already using Update Compliance and have configured your devices prior to May 10, 2021, you must rerun the script so the new policy can be configured. We don't recommend using this script if you configure devices using MDM. Instead, configure the policies listed in [Manually configuring devices for Update Compliance](update-compliance-configuration-manual.md) by using your MDM provider. You should check devices to ensure that there aren't any policy configurations in any existing tool that conflict with how policies should be configured. 

The Update Compliance Configuration Script is the recommended method of configuring devices to send data to Microsoft for use with Update Compliance. The script configures the registry keys backing policies, ensures required services are running, and more.

> [!NOTE]
> The configuration script configures registry keys directly. Registry keys can potentially be overwritten by policy settings like Group Policy or MDM. *Reconfiguring devices with the script does not reconfigure previously set policies, both in the case of Group Policy and MDM*. If there are conflicts between your Group Policy or MDM configurations and the required configurations listed in [Manually configuring devices for Update Compliance](update-compliance-configuration-manual.md), there can be issues with device enrollment. 

You can download the script from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=101086). Keep reading to learn how to configure the script and interpret error codes that are output in logs for troubleshooting.

## Script FAQ

- I manage my devices with MDM. Should I use this script?
No, you should not use this script. Instead configure the policies through your MDM provider. 
- Does this script configure devices for Delivery Optimization?
No. You must do that separately.

## How this script is organized

This script's two primary files are `ConfigScript.ps1` and `RunConfig.bat`. You configure `RunConfig.bat` according to the directions in the `.bat` itself, which will then run `ConfigScript.ps1` with the parameters entered to `RunConfig.bat`. There are two ways of using the script: in **Pilot** mode or **Deployment** mode. 

- In **Pilot** mode (`runMode=Pilot`), the script will enter a verbose mode with enhanced diagnostics, and save the results in the path defined with `logpath` in `RunConfig.bat`. Pilot mode is best for a pilot run of the script or for troubleshooting configuration.
- In **Deployment** mode (`runMode=Deployment`), the script will run quietly. 


## How to use this script

Open `RunConfig.bat` and configure the following (assuming a first-run, with `runMode=Pilot`):

1. Define `logPath` to where you want the logs to be saved. Ensure that `runMode=Pilot`.
2. Set `commercialIDValue` to your Commercial ID.
3. Run the script.
4. Examine the logs for any issues. If there are no issues, then all devices with a similar configuration and network profile are ready for the script to be deployed with `runMode=Deployment`.
5. If there are issues, gather the logs and provide them to Support.

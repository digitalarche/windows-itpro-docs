<!--Description-->
Available in the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build. This policy setting permits or prohibits the use of this snap-in. 

If you enable this policy setting, the snap-in is permitted and can be added into the Microsoft Management Console or run from the command line as a standalone console. 

If you disable this policy setting, the snap-in is prohibited and cannot be added into the Microsoft Management Console or run from the command line as a standalone console. An error message is displayed stating that policy is prohibiting the use of this snap-in. 

If this policy setting is not configured, the setting of the "Restrict users to the explicitly permitted list of snap-ins" setting determines whether this snap-in is permitted or prohibited. 

- If the policy setting "Restrict users to the explicitly permitted list of snap-ins" is enabled, users cannot use any snap-in except those explicitly permitted. To explicitly permit use of this snap-in, enable this policy setting. If this policy setting is not configured or disabled, this snap-in is prohibited. 

- If the policy setting "Restrict users to the explicitly permitted list of snap-ins" is disabled or not configured, users can use any snap-in except those explicitly prohibited. To explicitly prohibit use of this snap-in, disable this policy setting. If this policy setting is not configured or enabled, the snap-in is permitted. 

When a snap-in is prohibited, it does not appear in the Add/Remove Snap-in window in MMC. Also, when a user opens a console file that includes a prohibited snap-in, the console file opens, but the prohibited snap-in does not appear.

When a snap-in is prohibited, it does not appear in the Add/Remove Snap-in window in MMC. Also, when a user opens a console file that includes a prohibited snap-in, the console file opens, but the prohibited snap-in does not appear.
<!--/Description-->
> [!TIP]
> This is an ADMX-backed policy and requires a special SyncML format to enable or disable. For details, see [Understanding ADMX-backed policies](./understanding-admx-backed-policies.md).
> 
> You must specify the data type in the SyncML as &lt;Format&gt;chr&lt;/Format&gt;. For an example SyncML, refer to [Enabling a policy](./understanding-admx-backed-policies.md#enabling-a-policy).
> 
> The payload of the SyncML must be XML-encoded; for this XML encoding, there are a variety of online encoders that you can use. To avoid encoding the payload, you can use CDATA if your MDM supports it. For more information, see [CDATA Sections](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-cdata-sect).

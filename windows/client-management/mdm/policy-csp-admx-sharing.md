<!--/Scope-->
<!--Description-->
Available in the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview Build. This policy setting specifies whether users can share files within their profile. By default users are allowed to share files within their profile to other users on their network after an administrator opts in the computer.  An administrator can opt in the computer by using the sharing wizard to share a file within their profile.

If you enable this policy setting, users cannot share files within their profile using the sharing wizard.  Also, the sharing wizard cannot create a share at %root%\users and can only be used to create SMB shares on folders.

If you disable or don't configure this policy setting, users can share files out of their user profile after an administrator has opted in the computer.

<!--/Description-->
> [!TIP]
> This is an ADMX-backed policy and requires a special SyncML format to enable or disable. For details, see [Understanding ADMX-backed policies](./understanding-admx-backed-policies.md).
> 
> You must specify the data type in the SyncML as &lt;Format&gt;chr&lt;/Format&gt;. For an example SyncML, refer to [Enabling a policy](./understanding-admx-backed-policies.md#enabling-a-policy).
> 
> The payload of the SyncML must be XML-encoded; for this XML encoding, there are a variety of online encoders that you can use. To avoid encoding the payload, you can use CDATA if your MDM supports it. For more information, see [CDATA Sections](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-cdata-sect).

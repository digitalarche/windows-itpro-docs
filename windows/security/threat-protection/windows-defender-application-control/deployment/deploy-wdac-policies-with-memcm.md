# Deploy WDAC policies by using Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MEMCM)

**Applies to:**

- Windows 10
- Windows Server 2016 and above

You can use Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (MEMCM) to configure Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) on client machines.

## Use MEMCM's built-in policies

MEMCM includes native support for WDAC, which allows you to configure Windows 10 client computers with a policy that will only allow:

- Windows components
- Microsoft Store apps
- Apps installed by MEMCM (MEMCM self-configured as a managed installer)
- [Optional] Reputable apps as defined by the Intelligent Security Graph (ISG)
- [Optional] Apps and executables already installed in admin-definable folder locations that MEMCM will allow through a one-time scan during policy creation on managed endpoints.

For more information on using MEMCM's native WDAC policies, see [Windows Defender Application Control management with Configuration Manager](/mem/configmgr/protect/deploy-use/use-device-guard-with-configuration-manager)

## Deploy custom WDAC policies using Packages/Programs or Task Sequences

Using MEMCM's built-in policies can be a helpful starting point, but customers may find the available circle-of-trust options available in MEMCM too limiting. To define your own circle-of-trust, you can use MEMCM to deploy custom WDAC policies using [script-based deployment](deploy-wdac-policies-with-script.md) via Software Distribution Packages and Programs or Operating System Deployment Task Sequences.

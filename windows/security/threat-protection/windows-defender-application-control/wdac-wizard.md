# Windows Defender Application Control Wizard

**Applies to:**

-   Windows 10
-   Windows Server 2016 and above

The Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policy Wizard is an open source Windows desktop application written in C# and bundled as an MSIX package. The Wizard was built to provide security architects, security and system administrators with a more user-friendly means to create, edit, and merge WDAC policies. The Wizard desktop application uses the [ConfigCI PowerShell Cmdlets](/powershell/module/configci) in the backend so the output policy of the Wizard and PowerShell cmdlets is identical. 

## Downloading the application

The WDAC Wizard can be downloaded from the official [Wizard installer website](https://bit.ly/3koHwYs) as an MSIX packaged application. The Wizard's source code is available as part of Microsoft's Open Source Software offerings on GitHub at the [WDAC Wizard Repo](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WDAC-Toolkit). 

**Supported Clients**

As the WDAC Wizard uses the cmdlets in the background, the Wizard is functional on clients only where the cmdlets are supported as outlined in [WDAC feature availability](feature-availability.md). Specifically, the tool will verify that the client meets one of the following requirements: 

-   Windows builds 1909+
-   For pre-1909 builds, the Enterprise SKU of Windows is installed

If neither requirement is satisfied, the Wizard will throw an error as the cmdlets are not available.

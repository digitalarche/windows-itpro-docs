# System requirements for Microsoft Defender Application Guard

**Applies to:** [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2069559)

The threat landscape is continually evolving. While hackers are busy developing new techniques to breach enterprise networks by compromising workstations, phishing schemes remain one of the top ways to lure employees into social engineering attacks. Microsoft Defender Application Guard is designed to help prevent old, and newly emerging attacks, to help keep employees productive.

> [!NOTE]
> Given the technological complexity, the security promise of Microsoft Defender Application Guard (MDAG) may not hold true on VMs and in VDI environments. Hence, MDAG is currently not officially supported on VMs and in VDI environments. However, for testing and automation purposes on non-production machines, you may enable MDAG on a VM by enabling Hyper-V nested virtualization on the host.

## Hardware requirements
Your environment needs the following hardware to run Microsoft Defender Application Guard.

|Hardware|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|64-bit CPU|A 64-bit computer with minimum 4 cores (logical processors) is required for hypervisor and virtualization-based security (VBS).
